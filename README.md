# rendering-with-luxcore-in-blender-with-google-colab
first you should watch this vid https://youtu.be/eOxawEi5cNk not my vid but it will help a lot i also used his colab to make this one so give him most of the credits.

all you need to do is install the blendluxcore build you want from here https://github.com/LuxCoreRender/BlendLuxCore/releases download the linux version
than press save as and save it with the name "blendluxcore" (dont extract the zip file only change the name of the zip file to blendluxcore) 
now make a folder in your google drive named "luxcore" (it can't be in any supfolder) you put the zip file (named "blendluxcore") you just installed in there 
you also put the file named install.py in there (from here to the folder in your google drive named luxcore) 
then you should run all command and see if it works if it doesn't make an issue here i might be going to respond.

and if you have things to add make a issue or pull request (i'm pretty new to github so i dont know that much about it yet)
